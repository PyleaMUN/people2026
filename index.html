                <p>Hi everyone! My name is <strong>Alexandra Moutropoulou</strong>, and I recently graduated from the Faculty of Law at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. I still remember participating in my very first MUN conference as a high school student — little did I know how much it would shape my academic and personal journey. Since then, I have taken part in over 20 MUN conferences, both in Greece and abroad, serving in various roles such as delegate, chair, and member of the Secretariat. I also had the honor of serving as President of the United Nations Society of AUTh during the 2024–2025 academic year, an experience that truly deepened my commitment to diplomacy, dialogue, and leadership. To all those who are just beginning their MUN journey, my advice is this: never be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and never set limits on what you can achieve!</p>

I started my MUN journey 3 years ago not knowing that it will become one of my most valuable and enjoyable experiences. Throughout my MUN career, I have been privileged to represent a variety of countries in committees such as GA4, GA6, and GA1. Each conference has improved my cooperation skills, my public speaking capabilities, and stress control. I was also truly fortunate to participate in MUNS both in my native country and abroad, which has allowed me to make friendships with students from different countries and backgrounds and experience other cultures.</p>
                    <p>As a chair, my ambition for the PyleaMUN NATO committee is to foster the same love for MUNS in my delegates as I had my first time participating. In addition, I wish to create a respectful environment in which every delegate feels confident in participating. I aspire to guide the delegates and ensure that our committee is productive and enjoyable for all.</p>

I look forward to facilitating fruitful and engaging debates throughout this year’s conference. My experience in various positions within MUN, has deepened my interest for diplomacy and policy-making, which has now culminated into an enthusiasm I am eager to share. As we reevaluate the relevance of NATO within a volatile global scene, my aim is to foster an inclusive environment, where every voice is valued, paving the way towards meaningful growth and collaboration.</p>

Since I was little, I have always been fascinated by the humanities so starting extra-curricular activities such as speech and debate, but mostly MUN was the natural path for me. Serving as a Co-Chair in PyleaMUN’s Human Rights Council is both an outmost honour but also something I view as a reflection of my admiration for diplomacy. My MUN journey started when I was in the ninth grade, and ever since I’ve fallen in love with it. Along the way, I have been humbled to receive awards such as the <strong>Best Delegate in the 7th DSTMUN Security Council</strong>, but above that, I’ve gained experiences through lovely conferences, and I strive to create such an engaging and respectful environment with fruitful discussions when serving in the HRC committee.</p>
