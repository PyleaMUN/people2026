                <p>Hi everyone! My name is <strong>Alexandra Moutropoulou</strong>, and I recently graduated from the Faculty of Law at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. I still remember participating in my very first MUN conference as a high school student — little did I know how much it would shape my academic and personal journey. Since then, I have taken part in over 20 MUN conferences, both in Greece and abroad, serving in various roles such as delegate, chair, and member of the Secretariat. I also had the honor of serving as President of the United Nations Society of AUTh during the 2024–2025 academic year, an experience that truly deepened my commitment to diplomacy, dialogue, and leadership. To all those who are just beginning their MUN journey, my advice is this: never be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and never set limits on what you can achieve!</p>
